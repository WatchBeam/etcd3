/**
 * A Lock can be used for distributed locking to create atomic operations
 * across multiple systems. An EtcdLockFailedError is thrown if the lock
 * can't be acquired.
 *
 * Under the hood, the Lock uses a lease on a key which is revoked when the
 * the lock is released. If the server the lock is running on dies, or the
 * network is disconnected, etcd will time out the lock.
 *
 * Bear in mind that this means that in certain rare situations (a network
 * disconnect or wholesale etcd failure), the caller may lose the lock while
 * operations may still be running.
 *
 * A quick example:
 *
 * ```
 * const { Etcd3 } = require('etcd3');
 * const client = new Etcd3();
 *
 * client.lock('my_resource').do(() => {
 *   // The lock will automatically be released when this promise returns
 *   return doMyAtomicAction();
 * });
 * ```
